# Exploring the Quantum Nature of Light

### Skills: experience with infared light, correlated photons, coincidence counts, polarization, real-time optimization of photon counts, collumation, laser alignment, consturction of counting model with PSoC (code written by Dr. Masters) including milling circuit board and laser cutting, software built with python for visualization 

## Spontaneousp Parametric Downconversion

### Skills: coincidence counts, BBO crystals, Single Photon Counting Machines 


Parts list that I countstructed and purchased to conduct experiements:
