# Exploring the Quantum Nature of Light

### Skills: experience with infrared and ultraviolet light, correlated photons, coincidence counts, polarization, real-time optimization of photon counts, collumation, laser alignment, consturction of counting modul with PSoC including milling circuit board and laser cutting, software built with python for visualization 

I began working on this project my senior year of undergrad earning me Outstanding Physics Research of the Year at Purdue Fort Wayne. I've worked professors, LTLs, GTAs,and undergraduates on this project for about two and a half years. This project includes three experiements all focused on the photon model of light. Tanjentally, Spencer Kelham and I worked on building cost effect Single Photon Counting Machines and we determed the window for photon counts of our PSoC counting modul, which will all be discussed below.

## Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion
### Skills: coincidence counts, BBO crystals, Single Photon Counting Machines 


Parts list that I countstructed and purchased to conduct experiements:

Note: the following code was built by Justin Smethers and I made some minor adjustments to make it more user friendly.
#### [Python code](https://github.com/jacobsc050/quantum-mechanics/blob/main/coincidence-counting.py)
